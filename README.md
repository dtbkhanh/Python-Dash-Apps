This repository contains interactive Dash applications built using Plotly Dash in Python. These apps are designed to visualize and analyze data with rich interactive features. Each app follows a modular structure with separate files for layout, callbacks, and data processing.

## 📁 Folder Structure
Each app folder follows this structure:

```plaintext
app_name/
│
├── app.py               # Main application
├── data_processing.py   # Data processing functions
├── callbacks.py         # Callbacks for interactivity
└── layout.py            # Layout design
```
